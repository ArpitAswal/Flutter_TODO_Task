Project Name: Todo Tasks
Description:

Todo Tasks is a mobile application built using the Flutter framework, designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to add, edit, and track their tasks, whether they are related to personal goals, study plans, or future events.

Features:

Task Management:
The app uses a TabBar and TabBarView to organize tasks into two categories:

Pending Tasks: Displays all added tasks that are yet to be completed.

Completed Tasks: Shows tasks that have been marked as completed.

Users can navigate between these views using the tabs or by sliding the screen.

Adding Tasks:
Users can create new tasks by providing a title, description, and start date, which are required fields.

Each task comes with three management options:

Edit Task: Accessible by sliding the task from left to right.

Delete Task: Accessible by sliding the task from right to left.

Mark as Done: Available for pending tasks, allowing users to mark tasks as completed.

Completed Tasks View:
In the completed tasks view, users can only delete tasks by sliding from right to left.
